# One Billion iPhones

The idea of the project is to represent the enormity utilization of smartphones, in particular Apple’s device, the iPhone.
An iPhone represent many things: high technology, luxury, a good usage of design and also a part of out daily life.
But what if it could represent other things?
What if you start to use your iPhone to measure things?
That’s what our project it’s about: bringing off scale the device in your pocket and use to out of it’s context.

Each of us developed a different sort of interaction with the computer that could better represent each of our decontextualization.


CHALLENGES

DIFFICULTIES

The main challenges where linked to the partial knowledge of coding in JavaScript, especially the connection and execution of commands following the activations of a specific event or interaction.





# Price

My project aims to presente the turnover around the iPhones.
And it’s huge. Through a simple metaphor, selling a good swiping within a cash register (and earring the familiar sound) I want to make the user feel the complexity and the huge number of it.


# Length

The purpose of the project is to calculate how much distance you can cover if you line up, considering the longer side, all the iPhones sold since the first model up to the iPhone SE. Based on the fact that the number of phones sold reached one billion pieces even before the release of iPhone 7, I could imagine this distance as huge, but what I did not expect was to entirely cover the Earth from the Artic Circle to the Antarctica almost seven times. 

The idea of let the user have a trip across the sky in a spatial environment is the direct consequence of the great distance to be covered, precisely 133,609 kilometers, calculating the route on the size of the diameter of each planet part our Solar System. 

Basically, the project consists in a trip simulation in first person where the user can travel through different planets and our satellite. Earth, Moon, Mars, Venus and the big Saturn which is the only planet not completely circled due to its very large size.
In order to accompany the immersion into the interplanetar trip, there is some useful information which let the user understand how many millions of iPhone have been lined up since the travel started, which model of iPhone is currently lined up and its size in millimeters and also how many kilometers have been traveled in total.

The main challenge was representing a three-dimensional world in only two dimensions, the solution to pretend the depth with flat pictures and overlay levels was the simplest and probably the most successful.
